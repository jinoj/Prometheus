Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community.

Features

Prometheus's main features are:

    a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
    a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
    no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
    time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
    pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
    targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
    multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support

Node Exporter:
==============
Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels, written in Go with pluggable metric collectors.

wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v0.15.2/node_exporter-0.15.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz


Alert Manager
=============
The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integrations such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.
